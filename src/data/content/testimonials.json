    "text": "Vladyslav was one of the first engineers to join SRG+ and played a crucial role in building the backend foundation of our Digital Asset Management platform. From the start, he showed a rare combination of technical depth, initiative, and product awareness that had a clear impact on both the speed and quality of our development.\n\nHe led the design and implementation of core backend services using .NET and Google Cloud Run, managed our MongoDB data layer, and set up Mixpanel for actionable analytics. His approach to architecture emphasized clarity, performance, and long-term maintainability.\n\nA standout part of his work was asset handling. Vladyslav integrated Cloudflare R2 as our object storage - streamlining how we managed uploaded assets. He also implemented custom Cloudflare Workers for file validation and post-processing to keep everything lightweight, efficient, and serverless.\n\nHe handled a wide range of third-party integrations - including Auth0 for authentication, external APIs, and various internal services - always with a focus on reliability, clean interfaces, and future-proofing.\n\nVladyslav doesn't just deliver what's asked - he asks the right questions, challenges assumptions when appropriate, and consistently thinks a few steps ahead. He was a calm, thoughtful, and trusted member of the team - someone I'd gladly work with again.",
