{"name":"Vlad Timchenko","about":{"title":"About","paragraphs":["Cloud-native .NET backend engineer. I build and run production systems for data-intensive and event-driven workloads: high-load services, time-series data, and messaging. I design and operate C# and .NET services with PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB, using RabbitMQ, Kafka, and Pub/Sub on Google Cloud.","I've worked in enterprise and startups, owning backend end-to-end: API design and data modeling, CI/CD and deployments, monitoring and on-call. I care more about systems that stay predictable under real traffic than about architecture diagrams.","I use Google Cloud (and AWS or Azure when needed), plus Python, JavaScript, and Bash for automation and pipelines. What I enjoy most is turning messy, real-world data into reliable, observable systems that teams can trust."]},"sectionTabs":[{"id":"about","label":"About"},{"id":"experience","label":"Experience"},{"id":"volunteering","label":"Volunteering"},{"id":"education","label":"Education"},{"id":"testimonials","label":"Testimonials"},{"id":"projects","label":"Projects"}],"experience":{"title":"Experience","commercialLabel":"Commercial experience"},"volunteering":{"title":"Volunteering"},"education":{"title":"Education"},"testimonials":{"title":"Testimonials","description":"Recommendations from colleagues and clients."},"projects":{"title":"Projects"}}
